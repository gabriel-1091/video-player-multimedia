This project involves creating a video player application that allows users to watch a collection of videos stored within the application.
Users can:
- navigate through the playlist
- add new videos via input control
- modify the order of videos in the playlist by drag and drop
- delete files from the playlist
- autoplay videos

Additionally, users can interact with the video player's semi-transparent controls (previous, play/pause, next, progress bar, volume) drawn on the canvas which determines user operations based on the cursor's position.
Other features include frame preview functionality and storing settings using the Web Storage API.

Built using Javascript / HTML / CSS.
